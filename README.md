onSpaceStart

Simple game based on the Mibbu framework, will be made to promote onGameStart - html5 game conference in Poland.

I'm not sure yet if it will be a copy of Asteroids (moving your spaceship in every direction) with some sneaky original idea (like shooting to / avoiding bad parts of code, or picking up speakers' photos), or maybe it will be more something like moving background in one direction (spasheship moving up or right) and avoiding some obstacles in the way. The perfect situation is to have it working for single player, and then add the server part (in Node.js?) to manage highscores etc.
